Kender â€” Plan less. Do more. 
=======================================
Designed to help users optimize their coming weekend (or the next three days if the weekend *just* can't come fast enough), Kender provides one consolidated place to find an accurate, location-based weather forecast, a curated playlist based on moods associated with the weather, and some upcoming events in the user's city with detailed information. The weather, playlist, and events are dynamically generated by utilizing three different powerful API's from the Open Weather Map, Spotify, and Eventbrite, and users are presented with the option to further customize which sorts of playlists and events they will see on the page.

## Technologies Used
+ Page elements and styling are written with HTML5 and CSS3, and the app's logic is written with Javascript. 
  
+ The app utilizes the jQuery library to dynamically update elements on the page. 
  
+ Built using Materialize.css, a CSS framework that includes many built-in features that the app utilizes, such as cards, carousels, the parallax effect for background gifs/images, and modal popup windows that can be easily dismissed in place of obnoxious alerts. Materialize also uses the grid system, and provides built-in responsiveness to make our app more mobile-friendly.

+ User input data from the form on the app's landing page is stored with Firebase, so that user login information can be stored in a more permanent way and users won't need to re-enter information they've already entered upon re-visiting the app.
  
+ The app makes AJAX calls to three different API's: 
   +  Open Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/api
   +  Spotify: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
   +  Eventbrite: https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api

## How to Use the App

1. When you enter the app for the first time, you will be prompted to sign up using your email and provide your location.
   
2. After signing-up/signing-in, you will be re-located to our main content page, where you will be able to see and interact with your upcoming weather, listen to your new playlist or choose a new one using the buttons you'll see below it, and peruse upcoming events in your area.
   
3. Enjoy! All of the features allow you to further customize or get some new options if you aren't satisfied with what you see, or if you just feel like browsing.
